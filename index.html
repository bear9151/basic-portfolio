			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<p>
			Oh, hi there! You've come across my little piece of the internet machine. Aren't you lucky? When first meeting someone, we ask, "What do you do?" I'd rather ask, "Who are you?" "What drives you in life?" "What do you want to do?"
			</p>
			<p>
			I'm an INNOVATOR. I am a 27-years-young resident of Orlando, Florida. Technology sparks my interest. Creative software excites me to create and inspire. I use my creativity to solve problems and try to come up with the simplest, most efficient way to accomplish something--even if it means completely redefining the approach. "Why?" is my favorite question.
			</p>
			<p>
			Secondly, I'm a COMMUNICATOR. I am a proud graduate of Louisiana State University with a Bachelor's degree in Mass Communication. This tiger enjoys evaluating brands and their impact. I've worked for a nifty little firm called Covalent Logic. I can't watch TV and movies without subconsciously analyzing product placement opportunities. People tell me I'm a "people" person.
			</p>
			<p>
			I also think of myself as an ENTERTAINER. I believe we all pursue happiness as humans, making entertainment necessary in our daily lives. Born and raised in south Louisiana, I know that a good Cajun meal around family tops nothing else. 'Letting the good times roll' allows me to live each day to the fullest. I help bring Disney Characters to life with Walt Disney Imagineering. Acting and improv interest me. Musicals and show tunes make any day brighter.
			</p>
			<p>
			Every day I want to learn more and discover life, new cultures, new places, and new faces. My heroes include Lady Gaga, Steve Jobs, Ellen DeGeneres, and Walt Disney. I hope to do great things in the future, but most importantly become a person of integrity, success and happiness.
